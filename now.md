Here is the list of things that I am spending my most valuable asset on, my time. The list is ordered from most to least time spent per day.

#### Real Estate Investing
We have 7 properties under construction in the Metro Detroit area, along with 3 rental properties. Most of our updates and rehab adventures are put on [our website](http://blackcombequity.com/).

#### Strength Training
So I can perform movements like muscle ups, pistol squats, and free standing handstand push ups.

#### Endurance Training
So I can bike 160 miles across the state of Florida to [raise money to feed hungry children](http://panfloridachallenge.racepartner.com/Fundraising/armueller).
